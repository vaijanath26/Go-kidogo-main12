            We all met in a programming class. Of course, we wanted to program fun games. After the first 2-3 meetings, we talked about plastic and the "FRIDAYS-FOR-FUTURE" demos. We all agreed that it is also imperative that individuals reconsider their consumption patterns. This also includes the use of technologies and service offers.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>For many of our daily "conveniences" we could pay a very high price in the future.</p>
          <br />

          <p>The discussions were so moving and inspiring that our mentor suggested taking a small step towards a sustainable world together.</p>
          <br />

          <p>Through a scrum session and other product discussions, we came up with the idea of coding a sustainable delivery portal. Go Kidogo is therefore a good example of the fact that we not only have to rethink technologies for even more convenience, but especially in the present time for a just and sustainable world.</p>
          <br />

          <p>At Go Kidogo, we value the essentials: quality of the food, fairness towards our restaurant partners and sustainable packaging.</p>

        </p>

        <p>
          On average, one person produces 226.5 kilograms of packaging waste every year.
          <br />
          The consumption of service packaging (out-of-home consumption) in the catering industry increased by 325 percent from 2000 to 2020.
          <br />
          According to a Statista forecast, a total of 17.1 million people will use online food delivery services this year. By 2023, the number is expected to rise to 21.6 million.

        <p className="lead">
          <h3 style={{ color: "#777" }}>Our approach</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          We are sustainable and promote sustainability; Our restaurants deliver the food completely packaging-free.
          <br />
          With our high-quality reusable packaging, we are declaring war on disposable packaging for take-away food. Go Kidogo stands for sustainable management and consumption. (Green Economy).

          <h3 style={{ color: "#777" }}>Our approach</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          With Go Kidogo, we have created an environmentally friendly and sustainable online delivery portal for ordering meals by using
          <br />
          a returnable deposit system for take-away meals.
          <br />
          Our reusable containers are made from 100% QUALITY PLASTIC and are also 100% recyclable. In addition, they are absolutely free of
          <br />
          harmful substances.

          <h3 style={{ color: "#777" }}>Our guiding principles</h3>
        </p>
        <p>according to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Don't go hungry: According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), around 1.3 billion tons of food ends up in the trash every year. At the same time, 821.6
            <br />
            million people are starving â€“ a scandal! We want to save food and thus fight hunger."
          </li>
          <li>
            Less inequality: We want to enable restaurateurs to participate in the digital economy at market-oriented and fair conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sustainable consumption: With Go Kidogo, we want to encourage consumers to rethink their consumption. Conscious enjoyment and
            <br />
            conservation of resources is our motto.
          </li>
          <li>
            Climate action: Our planet needs help, that much is clear. With our company, we are trying to make the constantly growing industry of food
            <br />
            delivery services more climate-neutral. The transfer of knowledge on the topic of climate protection is therefore an important part of our work.
          </li>
        </ul>
