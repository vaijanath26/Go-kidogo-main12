This data is technically necessary for us and ensures the stability and security of the website.
The web server automatically recognizes certain personal data such as your IP address, the date and time you are on our site, the pages you visited on our website, the website you were on before, the website you used Browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari), the operating system you are using (e.g. Windows, Linux, MAC OS) and the domain name and address of your Internet provider (e.g. 1&1, Telekom, unitmedia). If our website uses cookies (as explained below), the web server also stores this information (legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1f DS-GVO).
We regularly evaluate these server logs anonymously for statistical purposes (click stream analysis) so that we can determine how our websites are used. We then optimize our website on the basis of these findings.<br/>
In addition, in the event of system abuse, we may use this information in cooperation with your ISP and/or local authorities to determine who caused the abuse.<br/>
b) In addition to the aforementioned data, cookies are stored on your computer when you use our website. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your hard drive in the browser you are using and through which certain information flows to the place that sets the cookie (here from us). Cookies cannot run programs or transmit viruses to your computer. They serve to make the Internet offer more user-friendly and effective overall.<br/>
c) Third-party cookies on our websites<br/>
We allow third parties to place cookies on your computer through these websites.<br/>
(1) This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymization is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.<br/>
(2) The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.<br/>
(3) You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; we would like to point out to you however that in this case you will if applicable not be able to use all functions of this website in full. You can also prevent the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) being sent to Google and the processing of this data by Google by using the browser plug-in available under the following link. Download and install in: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.<br/>

If the data collected about you has a personal reference, this will be excluded immediately and the personal data will be deleted immediately.<br/>

d) Use of social media plug-ins<br/>
(1) We currently use the following social media plug-ins: Facebook. We use the so-called two-click solution. This means that when you visit our site, no personal data is initially passed on to the providers of the plug-ins. You can identify the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its initials or the logo. We give you the opportunity to communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in via the button. Only if you click on the marked field and thereby activate it will the plug-in provider be informed that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online offer. In addition, the data mentioned under point 2 of this declaration will be transmitted. In the case of Facebook and Xing, according to the respective providers in Germany, the IP address is anonymized immediately after collection. By activating the plug-in, your personal data is therefore transmitted to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of US providers in the USA). Since the plug-in provider collects data in particular via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies via the security settings of your browser before clicking on the grayed-out box.<br/>

Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (also for users who are not logged in) to display needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, You must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this. With the plug-ins we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users, so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter f GDPR.<br/>
(4) The data is passed on regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged in there. If you are logged in to the plug-in provider, your data collected from us will be assigned directly to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you press the activated button and e.g. B. link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, but especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider.<br/>
(5) Further information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found in the data protection declarations of these providers. There you will also receive further information on your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy.
