  <h4>Which technologies do we use?</h4>
  <br/>
  <p>
    As previously mentioned, we use various technologies to collect data. Among other things, we use scripts, trackers and cookies. Below we explain the technologies we use.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>1. What is a script?</strong><br />
    A script is short program code that supports the functionality and interactivity of our website. This code can run on our server or on your device.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2. What is a tracker?</strong><br />
    A tracker is a short, invisible piece of text or an image on our website that is used to measure traffic on our website. To capture traffic, we use multiple trackers, each storing different information about you. We may also allow third parties to place trackers on our site to monitor traffic on our site for us.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3. What are cookies?</strong><br />
    A cookie is a simple, small text file that is sent with pages on our website and is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. Some cookies are only used to establish a connection between your activities on our website when you visit a website. Other cookies are persistently stored on your computer’s hard drive and are sent back to our servers or the servers of the third parties that set the cookies for us, when you return to our website.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>4. What are social media buttons?</strong><br />
    In addition to cookies, our websites also use social media buttons. These buttons are used to advertise ("like") or share ("tweet") websites on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and YouTube. These buttons work using code snippets sourced from Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and YouTube.

<br/>
  <h4>Why do we use these technologies?</h4>
  <br/>
  <p>
  We use cookies, trackers and scripts for various purposes, namely for functional, analytical and marketing purposes. Below we present an overview of the various purposes for using the technologies. For a specific overview of all technologies we use, the corresponding purposes and specific functions of the technologies, we would like to refer you to our Go Kidogo . We regularly update this list to provide you with the most accurate overview possible of the technologies we use.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>1. Functional Purposes</strong><br />
    We use various technologies to ensure that our website works optimally and is easy to use. We use scripts and cookies for this purpose. Scripts ensure that the website is interactive and that something actually happens when you click a button. Cookies are used to enable functions such as the shopping basket. Without cookies, the products you have selected could not be saved in the shopping basket. Saving your address is also a function that would not work without cookies. Some technologies that are used for functional purposes are so important for the functionality of our website that they cannot be switched off.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2. Analysis purposes</strong><br />
    We use cookies and trackers to analyze your behavior on our website in order to be able to improve our website and adapt it to your needs. We hope to be able to make our website as user-friendly as possible in this way. For example, we record which pages are visited most often and how you navigate our website
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3. Marketing Purposes</strong><br />
    Of course we hope that you will use our website as often as possible and for this reason we use cookies and trackers for advertising purposes. With the help of cookies we can offer you interesting offers and/or discounts. For this purpose, we analyze, among other things, how often you use our website and which products interest you. This enables us to better tailor our offer and our advertisements to your wishes. Another marketing purpose we use trackers for is to see if you are coming to our site from one of our advertising partners' websites. This is necessary because we need to pay our advertising partners for the customers who visit our website (or place an order on our platform) via their platform.
